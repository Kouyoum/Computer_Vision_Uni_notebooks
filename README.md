# Computer_Vision_Uni_notebooks
Notebooks of Computer Vision Projects I did during courses at Centrale Sup√©lec in 2020-2021


**1.  Instance Segmentation of Wrinkles on Carseats**

- Project with a carparts manufacturer, with the objective to detect Wrinkles on seats using DL
- Implementation of Mask R-CNN to solve the problem, using Detectron2 and PyTorch
- I had to remove the images for confidentiality purposes


**2. Nuclei Segmentation**

- Kaggle Competition with my classmates, as part of one the deliverables for the "Introduction to Deep Learning" Course
- Used a U-NET to solve the problem (binary segmentation)
- Used PyTorch
